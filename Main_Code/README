The code presented in LinearModel.R requires functions.R for its dependencies.

Requires data/2_df_transform.csv from python data cleaning and wrangling.

Note: All the Machine Learning models are saved (.sav format) in the models folder to save the training time. Please load the model directly from the models folder.

Run the notebooks in increasing number. Example: 1_EDA_and_Preprocessing.ipynb first then 
2_Feature_Selection_and_Transformations.ipynb and so on
