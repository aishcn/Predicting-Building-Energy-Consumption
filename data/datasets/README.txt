This folder contains the dataframes i have used in my analysis.

the binned data sets, midstate-hot-colstates.

the monthly temperature data sets, need to filter for avg, min and max

the auxillary regression datasets, regX are explantory variables and the reg Y is the response variable

---- things to do,
transform the site eui by doing cube root or logs. take a random sample of the df.

seasonal bins with equal weighted avg weights, for winter seasons use minimum temperatures and for the summer use the max temperatures.

Do differential analysis, to see patterns in change in weather that can provide explanationms to variation in site eui.
